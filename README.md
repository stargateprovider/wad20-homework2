## Task #1 - Fetch user profile information from users endpoint: (PÃ¤rt - tegelen)

- Make a drop-down menu on profile picture click

- Display user information, fetched from the endpoint, there

- Add two links to the drop-down menu

    - Browse: navigates to a new page browse.html

    - Log out: navigates to login.html

## Task #2 - Fetch posts from the endpoint:

- Dynamically load posts data form the endpoint

    - Display post text, create time, number of likes, author picture and name

    - If post has a media attachment, an image or a video, accordingly display an image or a video player

- make a like button interactive and change its background color when its clicked to indicate weather the post has been liked by user or not

## Task #3 - Fetch browse page information from the endpoint:

- Create new page browse.html

    - Display account picture and name and subscribe button (See the "Profiles Collection" in API docs)

    - make the subscribe button interactive and change its background color when its clicked to indicate weather user has subscribed or not
    
This is not listed in the requirements of 'task #3' but it would be nice if clicking on the POSTIT logo in the header section would load index.html.
